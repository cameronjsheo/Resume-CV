<div class = "contentBx">
<h3>I'm a B.Sc. in Information Technology Graduate.</h3>
<p> I have recently completed my studies at North West University and will receive my official degree in June this year. 
  I am very grateful that I was given the opportunity and also very honoured to have passed my degree with distinction. 
  My university experience has been challenging, I have gained a lot of knowledge during these past three years and have 
  had my fair share of ups and downs. I am currently trying to broaden my understanding on Cloud Computing
  and Artificial Intelligence with various online courses including Amazon (AWS) and Google. I am also looking into DevOps.</p>
<br>
<p>I am a quick and focused learner who can absorb new ideas and can communicate clearly and effectively. 
  I also possess good bonding skills and have an inquiring mind that is eager to broaden my knowledge in the industry. 
  I have a fascination with building websites, database management systems and general applications. 
  I also strive for a high degree in accuracy and attention to detail. 
<br>
<br>
My current interests are in video games, I absolutely love modifying games, currently trying to create some of my own mods. 
I find artificial intelligence fascinating and the idea of allowing machines to "think for themselves". 
I also enjoy computer assembly, even though some of the prices for components are way beyond my budget
<br>
<br>
I also like fishing, because even if I don't catch anything, its' still very relaxing and peaceful if no one steals my fishing spot. 
Finally, I enjoy socializing & traveling, I am always eager to make new friendships along the way. 
Overall, I am passionate about technology. I would love to be given the opportunity to learn more about it.</p>

<h3> Administrator Clerk, CLS Brokers; 2018 - 2020 </h3>
<br>
<p>CLS Insurance Brokers is a family owned business where I worked as an administrator, 
handling client queries, quotations and filing. I have learnt many skills throughout my employment
 such as good communication and listening skills, reporting and problem-solving. 
For a project for one of my modules, I had to create a database management system for a business. 
I decided to use CLS Brokers as inspiration for the project. This system was written in C# Visual Studio.
